        <h1>Golf Score Predictor v1.0 by Brennan Shrider</h1>
        <p class="summary">You will need just under 50 range balls and a putting green. Overall, you will need 72 shots to simulate your projected 18 and 9 hole score. Straight shots that are also good distance are called Good. Shots that are straight but too short are called Straight Short/Long. Shots that are curved for sure into the rough are called Waggle. Shots that go like one foot or fly out of bounds are called Pooch/OB. For wedges, its about hitting a targeted spot, not necessarily distance. Hopefully you know youre wedge distances, otherwise no excuses. For putts, please shoot 3 balls from 9 spots on the green. Only hit the ball once, do not putt in. Simply record the effectiveness of the initial shots</p>
